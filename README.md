# speer_fe_assessment
This was an assessment for an interview @ Speer Technologies. Time spent: ~6 hours

## My favourite element:
My favourite element would have to be the landing page. I think I got it looking very similar to the specifications, with the two lacking components being the font (I used a free font from Google that looks similar enough), and the "Try it now" animation. I used a linear gradient because I didn't have enough time to learn how to do the fancy animation requested. I felt this still got the bulk of the requirements down.

## Completed:
- Hero Section (minus the image transition animations)
- Red Section (with music!)
- Yellow Section (partially complete, couldn't figure out make the grey circles show the image)
- Perks Section
- Header &  "Try it Now" button (ran out of time to start animation of burger and it's functionality)

## Comments: 
- From what I gather from the specs, it seems like this website wanted a static header (stays there no matter what) but when you scroll up or down, it scrolls to the previous or next section. I looked into implementing this, but again, ran out of time. My shortcut was to copy paste the header (which is not ideal). I could have templated a "section" that has a header in it, to reduce code duplication.
- If I were to restart this, the biggest thing I need to work on is modularity. I started trying to be more modular in my programming near the end, but it would have made everything a lot easier to implement. And my commenting leaves much to be desired...
